First unzip the compressed file.
Then start running an instance of mongodb.
Then import the data into your mongodb connection.  The required mongodb collection
is in user-admin/users.json .  Make sure you create a database called exactly 'user-admin' .
Import the users.json file so that it becomes a collection called 'users'.

I found the easiest way to do this was using Studio3T: on the far left side
of the Studio3T window, where it shows your open connection and all the dbs inside
it, right-click on the connection icon and choose Import...
Then choose JSON-mongo shell and click Next.
Choose the correct file to import.  It will assume you want to create a new db
called 'user-admin' with a collection called 'users'.  Keep following the prompts
until the new db is created.

This app assumes your hostname is localhost and the mongodb port is 27017.

Don't forget to run npm install.

Now you should be ready to run the app.
In the terminal, cd to the app directory.
Then enter 'node server.js' .  Then in your browser go to: 'http://localhost:3000'

From that point on, you only need to use the browser.
You can sort the user data by clicking on the table headers. They're linked.
